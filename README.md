unstructred search:
           is like guessing a key number between 1 to 100 and the wrong guess won't give correct answer in the worst case we would have 99 calls to our classical oracle in order to find the solution ie the key number

in an example of unstructred search we dont get any information from previous guesses about the correct guesses about what the correct solution is o(N) times to locate an item within this
database size N with N being the number of item that we are searching through
